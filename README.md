Module 6 Challenge
Got help from a tutor.  Location from the beginning up until the linear regressions.  
Got help from a submission to the same moduel challenge inspired by code "def linear_regression_plot(x_values,y_values,title,text_coordinates):" which was the second line under ## Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship, and the code "# Create a DataFrame with the Northern Hemisphere data (Latitude >= 0)
nhemisphere_df = city_data_df.loc[(city_data_df["Lat"]>= 0)]" which was in the box immediately beneath.
